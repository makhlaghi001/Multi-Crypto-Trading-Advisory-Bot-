## Scope: For this project, our group has decided to develop a Cryptocurrency Advisory Bot, which will use machine learning technology models such as:


	Neural Network 
o	We have chosen neural networks as we believe 

	it has higher capacity and output

	they are versatile

	it can improve accuracy though multiple training and testing process.

	detect complex nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables, ability to detect all possible interactions between predictor variables, and the availability of multiple training
	Neural Networks-Deep Learning (for back testing)

Support Vector Machine 

AdaBoost Model 
 
## This advisory bot will indicate the following signals:

	Buy,

	Sell

	Hold 


## Indicators:

	Finta python library will be used to generate signals along with usage of SMA.

	Simple Moving day Averages (SMA) (Long and Short)

o	SMA is a great option for our indicator as it uses both long and short term moving average, which can be very helpful in understanding a cryptocurrency trajectory, as well entry and exit. 

 Parabolic Stop and Revers (PSAR)

	Bollinger Bands 

o	It helps determine whether prices are high or low on a relative basis. Bollinger Bands are separated into 2 bands, upper and lower bands with SMA being utilized together. 

	Relative Strength Index (RSI) 

o	It is useful in to predict the price behavior of a cryptocurrency, validate trends and trend reversals, providing short-term traders with buy, hold and sell signals.

## Cryptocurrency selection

	Bitcoin

	Dodge coin

	Lite coin 

	XRP

## Sources for Data:

	Coin Geko

	Coin Marketcap API

	Yahoo Finance API
